/// one (a Mac mini/Studio on an external display, pre-2021 MacBooks, any desktop
/// display). ``floating`` is the fallback: instead of an eared shape fused to the
/// menu-bar notch, the chrome renders as a free-floating rounded panel just below the
/// menu bar.
///
/// - ``auto`` - notch layout on a notched display, floating layout otherwise. The
///   default, and the right choice for almost every app.
/// - ``notch`` - always the notch layout, even on a display with no notch (the
///   eared shape then hangs from the bare menu bar; mostly useful for testing).
/// - ``floating`` - always the floating layout, even on a notched display.
