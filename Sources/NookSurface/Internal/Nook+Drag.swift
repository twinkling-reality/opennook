// File-drag state machine and `NookDragDestination` conformance for ``Nook``.

// AppKit delivers drag-session callbacks (`draggingEntered`/`Updated`/`Exited`/
// `Ended`, `performDragOperation`) on the main thread but with no ordering
// guarantee a state machine can lean on: `draggingExited` can arrive *before*
// `draggingEnded` for one session, a slow or rejected `onFileDrop` can let a fresh
// `draggingEntered` interleave, and `draggingUpdated` fires repeatedly. The
// ``Nook/DragSession`` enum below collapses all that into a single owner whose
// transitions are idempotent.
//
// Lives in its own file so `Nook.swift` stays focused on lifecycle/transition
// concerns. The stored `dragSession` property is still declared on `Nook` itself -
// only the surrounding state machine and the destination-callback conformance
