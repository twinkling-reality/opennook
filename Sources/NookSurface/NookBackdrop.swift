/// Three intentionally disjoint cases:
///
/// - ``vibrancy(_:)`` paints an `NSVisualEffectView` material with an optional darken
///   pass on top - the default frosted look, used when translucency is allowed.
/// - ``solid(_:)`` paints a flat opaque fill - used for `.solid` chrome styles and
///   whenever Reduce Transparency is on, where `NSVisualEffectView` is avoided.
/// - ``liquidGlass(_:)`` paints Apple's Liquid Glass material (macOS 26+), falling back
///   to a layered material-plus-specular-rim approximation on earlier systems.
///
/// These are *modes*, not flags. A caller picks one and supplies only the parameters
/// that mode needs - no more eleven-field configuration struct where half the fields
/// are dead per branch.

/// Extending to e.g. `.gradient(Gradient)` later is one new case and one new view
/// branch; existing callers keep compiling.
