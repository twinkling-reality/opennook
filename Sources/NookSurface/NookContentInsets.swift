/// `NookContentInsets` is the geometric equivalent of UIKit's `safeAreaInsets`,
/// surfaced to SwiftUI through `\.nookContentInsets`. The
/// chrome itself consumes this for its own top-bar icon clusters; host apps
/// read it when laying out content that pins to a corner or to a single edge:
///
/// ```swift
/// @Environment(\.nookContentInsets) private var insets
///
/// var body: some View {
///     VStack {
///         Spacer()
///         HStack {
///             Spacer()
///             Text("Disk: 720 MB")
///                 .padding(.trailing, insets.trailing)
///                 .padding(.bottom, insets.bottom)

/// paddings (the horizontal inset by `topCornerRadius`, the small bottom
/// safe-area strip) are already subtracted, so an inset of `0` means "the
/// chrome's geometry doesn't intrude into your frame on that edge."
///
/// Re-injection: a wrapper that adds its own padding around the host content
/// (the way `NookExpandedView` does) should subtract that padding and
/// re-inject the adjusted insets, so descendants see a value relative to their
