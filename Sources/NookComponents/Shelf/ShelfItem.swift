/// The bookmark is created **security-scoped** when possible, so a sandboxed host (which

/// Sandbox: a `.nonScoped` bookmark cannot resolve in a future sandboxed launch even
/// when the file is right there, so ``ShelfStore``'s purge rule preserves it instead
/// of silently corroding the shelf. Items persisted by older builds decode with
/// ``BookmarkKind/unknown`` and are treated like `.nonScoped` for purge purposes.

/// Under the App Sandbox, *touching the file's contents* - not just resolving the
/// bookmark - requires bracketing the access with
/// `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()`/`stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()`.
/// Use ``withResolvedURL(_:)`` for any synchronous read; it does the bracketing.
/// `resolveURL()` is for path-level use only (display, comparison) and does **not**
/// start access. Outbound drag uses file promises (see ``NookShelfView``) so the read
/// can hold scope for the duration of the copy.
