/// A self-contained notch app that can coexist with other modules in one host process
/// and be swapped onto the shared surface at runtime.
///
/// A module owns its home view, compact slots, theme, lifecycle hooks (all expressed
/// through the ``NookConfiguration`` it produces) and its product state and services
/// (held as stored properties - the module instance *is* its own dependency container).
///
/// A module is built by its factory with an isolated ``NookModuleContext``; conventionally
/// it captures the context and persists through `context.defaults` / `context.containerURL`.
/// ``onActivate()`` / ``onDeactivate()`` mark module switches: a switch deactivates the
/// outgoing module and activates the incoming one. The module the host launches with is
/// constructed already in the foreground and gets no ``onActivate()``, so work it runs while
/// in the foreground starts in its initializer as well (see ``onActivate()``).

    /// while that work is already running:
