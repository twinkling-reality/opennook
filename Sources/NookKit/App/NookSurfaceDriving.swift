/// `AppCoordinator` owns the notch chrome but should not be welded to the concrete

/// serialization, arbiter wiring - is what is worth testing without a real window.

/// This protocol is the abstraction. It captures exactly the surface API the
/// coordinator touches (verified against `AppCoordinator` and its extensions), and
/// nothing more. It lives in NookKit - *not* in NookSurface, which stays MIT and thin,
/// and *not* by widening `NookControllable`/`NookSurfacePresenting`. NookKit owns this
/// protocol, so conforming the MIT `Nook` to it via a retroactive `extension` here is
/// legal and leaves `Nook` itself untouched.
///
/// The `*Publisher` accessors bridge `Nook`'s `@Published` projections to type-erased
/// `AnyPublisher`s so the coordinator's Combine sinks bind against the protocol, not the
/// concrete type.
