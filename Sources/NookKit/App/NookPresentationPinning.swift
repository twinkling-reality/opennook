/// Holds the notch surface expanded while a module presents transient AppKit UI
/// that lives outside the notch window: a `.popover`, `.sheet`, or `.alert`.
///
/// **The problem.** Those presentations open a separate AppKit panel. The pointer
/// moves into that panel, which is outside the notch window, so the surface's
/// hover-tracking sees "exited" and auto-compacts, taking the popover down with
/// it. The same window-bounds escape also drops both signals that feed
/// ``AppCoordinator/isUserEngaged`` to `false` (`userInitiatedOpen` is false for
/// a hover-opened nook; `surface.isHovering` flips false when the pointer leaves
/// the notch window), so a same-process module's `.urgent` arbiter claim can be
/// granted at the same moment and yank the surface from underneath the popover.
///
/// **The shape.** A module acquires a *pin* while the transient UI is up. While
/// any pin is outstanding the broker projects two things:
///
/// 1. `AppCoordinator.setStaysExpandedOverride(_:)` is held `true`, suppressing
///    the hover-exit auto-compact at `Nook.swift`'s `Nook.updateHoverState(_:)`.
/// 2. ``AppCoordinator/isUserEngaged`` (and its ``AppCoordinator/userEngagementChanges``
///    publisher) report `true`, denying competing arbiter claims for the duration.
///
/// Pins are **ref-counted**. Two overlapping popovers each get their own handle;
/// the surface stays pinned until the last one releases. The coordinator only
/// sees the 0->1 and N->0 edges via ``pinChanges``.
///
/// **Lifecycle.** A handle releases on ``NookPresentationPinHandle/release()``
/// or on `deinit`, whichever comes first. Pair with a SwiftUI binding via
/// `View.nookKeepsExpanded(while:)` for the popover/sheet case; resolve the
/// broker through `\.appServices` for non-view contexts (long-running uploads,
/// coordinator-driven flows).
///
/// **Scope.** One broker instance is shared across every module in the host
/// process. ``AppServices`` is per-module, but the *surface* is app-global, so
/// module A pinning the surface must also block module B's competing arbiter
/// claim. The host builds the broker once in
/// ``NookHostConfiguration/makeRegistry()`` and ``NookModuleRegistry`` registers
/// it into every module's services as their contexts are constructed.
