import NookSurface

/// Decides who gets the notch surface when more than one transient presenter wants it.
///
/// One host process can run several modules, each with its own activity queue and
/// ambient indicators, all of them transient presenters. The arbiter resolves the
/// contention with a stack of granted claims:
///
/// - A claim is granted only if it outranks whatever currently holds the surface, the
///   user is not engaging the surface, and - for a claim from a background module - its
///   priority is `.urgent`.
/// - A higher-priority claim preempts a lower one: it is pushed on top and shows
///   immediately. The preempted claim stays on the stack; when it ends it simply leaves
///   the stack without disturbing the surface.
/// - The surface restores to its pre-presentation state only when the *last* claim
///   ends, so a run of back-to-back or stacked claims never flickers home in between.
/// - A module that is being switched away from (its `prepareForSwitchAway` has not
///   finished) is denied outright, whatever the priority.
///
/// Whenever the claim on top of the stack changes hands, `topClaimChanged` runs so the
/// coordinator can put the top claim's module's content on the surface - a background
/// module's urgent claim shows *that* module, not the foreground one.
///
/// The arbiter is policy only. It owns no surface state machine: every expand/compact/
/// hide it performs is handed to `runSerial`, which threads it through
/// `AppCoordinator.enqueueLifecycle` - the one serial chain all surface transitions run
/// on. The arbiter never serializes anything itself.
