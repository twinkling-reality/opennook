/// Host-supplied *launch defaults* for the process-global preferences that otherwise
/// only have framework defaults until the user changes them in the Settings UI:
/// appearance (palette / surface style / presentation / haptics / keep-open), the
/// global show/hide ``NookHotkey``, and the ``NookDisplayPreference``.
///
/// These are **seed** values, not overrides. They replace the framework `.default`
/// fallback used when nothing is persisted yet - so a host can ship its own out-of-box
/// look (e.g. dark, translucent, floating, pinned-open) and shortcut without the user
/// having to open Settings first. The moment the user changes one of these at runtime
/// the change is persisted and always wins; a seed value is **never written** to
/// `UserDefaults`, so revising a default in a later build still reaches users who never
/// touched that setting.
///
/// Appearance is kept field by field: changing the palette persists the palette alone, so
/// the surface style, keep-open lock, and every other field the user never changed keep
/// following these defaults. Resetting settings (``AppCoordinator/resetAllSettingsToDefaults()``,
/// or ``AppState/resetAppearancePreferences()`` and its siblings) forgets the user's choices
/// and returns to these defaults, not the framework's.
///
/// Because there is a single ``AppState`` per process, these are host-process-global -
/// set them on ``NookHostConfiguration/preferenceDefaults`` (multi-module) or, for the
/// single-module path, on ``NookConfiguration/preferenceDefaults`` (forwarded to the
/// synthesized host). The default value reproduces the framework exactly.
///
/// `Sendable`: assembled at a `main.swift`'s nonisolated top level and handed to
/// `NookApp.main`, which crosses to the main actor - like the configurations that carry
